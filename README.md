## How To Use
The application .exe can be found in the x64/Release folder and is supported on Windows OS. When the game starts you will be required to enter the number of players and then enter your names.

The controls for player 1 are the WASD keys. The controls for player 2 are the arrow keys. The aim of the game is to have your snake eat mice to grow a longer tail while also avoiding colliding with the maze walls or other obstacles moving around such as mongooses; 1000 score points are awarded for every mouse a player eats and 10 points are awarded for every move the player makes in the maze. In two player mode the aim of the game is to outsurvive the other player while simultaneously trying for a higher score.
